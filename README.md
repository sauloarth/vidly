Imaginary service for renting out movies developed on Node Backend Training on UDEMY.

## What I'm learning

* Express Routing
* Setting a status code on sending it back as response
* Using some useful Middlewares (third-party and built-in)
* how request processing pipeline works (order matters, next function)
* express.json() - create req.body on requrest and parse it
* Joi for make validations (awesome)
* Working with alternative environments
